/**
 * enum ieee80211_sta_info_flags - Stations flags
 *
 * These flags are used with &struct sta_info's @flags member, but
 * only indirectly with set_sta_flag() and friends.
 *
 * @WLAN_STA_AUTH: Station is authenticated.
 * @WLAN_STA_ASSOC: Station is associated.
 * @WLAN_STA_PS_STA: Station is in power-save mode
 * @WLAN_STA_AUTHORIZED: Station is authorized to send/receive traffic.
 *	This bit is always checked so needs to be enabled for all stations
 *	when virtual port control is not in use.
 * @WLAN_STA_SHORT_PREAMBLE: Station is capable of receiving short-preamble
 *	frames.
 * @WLAN_STA_ASSOC_AP: We're associated to that station, it is an AP.
 * @WLAN_STA_WME: Station is a QoS-STA.
 * @WLAN_STA_WDS: Station is one of our WDS peers.
 * @WLAN_STA_CLEAR_PS_FILT: Clear PS filter in hardware (using the
 *	IEEE80211_TX_CTL_CLEAR_PS_FILT control flag) when the next
 *	frame to this station is transmitted.
 * @WLAN_STA_MFP: Management frame protection is used with this STA.
 * @WLAN_STA_BLOCK_BA: Used to deny ADDBA requests (both TX and RX)
 *	during suspend/resume and station removal.
 * @WLAN_STA_PS_DRIVER: driver requires keeping this station in
 *	power-save mode logically to flush frames that might still
 *	be in the queues
 * @WLAN_STA_PSPOLL: Station sent PS-poll while driver was keeping
 *	station in power-save mode, reply when the driver unblocks.
 * @WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER: Station is a TDLS peer.
 * @WLAN_STA_TDLS_PEER_AUTH: This TDLS peer is authorized to send direct
 *	packets. This means the link is enabled.
 * @WLAN_STA_UAPSD: Station requested unscheduled SP while driver was
 *	keeping station in power-save mode, reply when the driver
 *	unblocks the station.
 * @WLAN_STA_SP: Station is in a service period, so don't try to
 *	reply to other uAPSD trigger frames or PS-Poll.
